################ Instructions ################ 
# In Ruby, there is a built in method/function to flatten arrays, 
# meaning it makes them one-dimensional: 

# nums = [1, 2, 3, [[4], 5], [[[6]]]]
# nums.flatten
#=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Your goal is to recreate this functionality without using the built in method/function. 
# You will be given a deeply nested array, or multi-dimensional array, 
# that will look similar to the examples below:

# nums = [1, 2, 3, [[4], 5], [[[6]]]]
# words = ["hi", "this is", [[["string"], "that is very"], [[[["nested"]]]]]]

# The contents of the array is not significant. Your method/function should take an input 
# of a multi-dimensional array and output a one-dimensional array. 
# More simply put, remove the deeply nested brackets to return a single array.
